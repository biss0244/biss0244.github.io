                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <!--Introduction, what course I am taking. < em > on Interactive Media Design for search engine keywords, < sup > on 1st-->
                <p>I am a student in my 1<sup>st</sup> year of <em>Interactive Media Design</em> at Algonquin College
                    School of Media & Design. I was drawn to this course because of the blend of art and technology. I
                    was born and raised in the Ottawa Valley. Growing up I have always had a fascination with web
                    design, going back to when I was in primary school and made my first website on Geocities. As well,
                    I am very interested in the idea of building a web presence to show my art.</p>

                <!--Continued introduction, talk about hobbies. abbr on 'RPGs'-->
                <p>I try to keep myself active as much as possible. If not physically, then I try to keep at least one
                    creative pursuit active in my life. My belief is that having a wide array of interests you actively
                    take part in will keep you so focused, that it is hard to find time to feel bad about yourself. I
                    have discovered that certain activities can help people overcome obstacles in their everyday life.
                    For instance; I believe RPGs <abbr title="Role Playing Games"></abbr> when played in a safe
                    environment can work wonders for people suffering from social anxiety, or having issues with simple
                    mathematics. I have many hobbies, and find myself picking new ones up often.
